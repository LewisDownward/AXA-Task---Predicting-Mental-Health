# AXA-Task---Predicting-Mental-Health

Project investigating the Kaggle Depression dataset to build machine learning models to predict the target variable 'History of Mental Health'.
This dataset includes factors such as comorbidities, physical disability, family history, income. 
The aim is to build models to identify individuals at risk of mental health issues, using machine learning algorithms and statistical tests.
